## üòï >> Why to use Scss ?


##  ü§î ‚ùì What is Difference between Sass and Scss ?
   `Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)`  and  `SCSS (Sassy CSS)` are both preprocessors
for CSS.  They both extend the basic functionality of CSS by adding variables, mixins, nesting, and other features to make CSS more powerful and easier to write.

The primary difference between Sass and SCSS is the syntax. Sass uses the `.sass` file extension and uses a whitespace-based syntax. SCSS uses the `.scss` file extension and has a syntax similar to CSS with braces and semicolons.

### Differences
1. Syntax: As mentioned above, Sass has a whitespace-based syntax while SCSS has a syntax similar to CSS.
2. File extension: Sass files have a .sass extension while SCSS files have a .scss extension.
3. Compatibility: SCSS is more widely used and supported by various tools and libraries.
4. Learning curve: Sass has a steeper learning curve due to its unique syntax, while SCSS is easier to learn for those who are familiar with CSS.
5. Migration: Migrating from Sass to SCSS is relatively easy, but the reverse migration can be more challenging.
