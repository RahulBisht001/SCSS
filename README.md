*  CSS with superpowers
Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

## What is Difference between Sass and Scss ?
   `Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)`  and  `SCSS (Sassy CSS)` are both preprocessors
for CSS.  They both extend the basic functionality of CSS by adding variables, mixins, nesting, and other features to make CSS more powerful and easier to write.

The primary difference between Sass and SCSS is the syntax. Sass uses the .sass file extension and uses a whitespace-based syntax. SCSS uses the .scss file extension and has a syntax similar to CSS with braces and semicolons.
